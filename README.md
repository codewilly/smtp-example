# SMTP Email Example

This is a simple API that sends emails using SMTP.
##### You can:
- Send email to one or more emails.
- Send a cc to one or more emails;
- Send a bbc to one or more emails;
- Send one or more attachments files;
- Send one or more attachments files from a direct link (does downlad and send);
- Use templates using one class-html resource.

You need a **SMTP provider to send emails**. In this case, we use the free Gmail SMTP provider.

If you have any sugestions or questions, please, send-me a message (or a email (LOL) )
